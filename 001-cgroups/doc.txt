Control group 

1. linux system for tracking , group , limiting , organizing the processes that run 
2. every process is tracked with cgroups
3. typically used to associate processes with resources
4. limit or priortize resource utizilation

Linux groups processes into a cgroup. That group has rules. The kernel enforces them continuously.



In cgroups, subsystems (modern name: controllers) are the individual resource governors. 
Each one controls one specific type of resource. No philosophy, no abstraction fluff—one knob, one resource

Key controllers :
cpu – caps or weights CPU time
memory – hard limits, OOM control
pids – limits number of processes
blkio / io – disk read/write throttling
cpuset – pin workloads to specific CPU cores
network 
devices
