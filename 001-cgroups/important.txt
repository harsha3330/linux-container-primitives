1. Identity & membership

cgroup.procs
List of PIDs in this cgroup
Writing a PID here moves the process

cgroup.controllers
What controllers exist on the system

cgroup.subtree_control
What controllers children are allowed to use



2.CPU control (performance & throttling)

cpu.max
The actual CPU limit
Example: 50000 100000 = 0.5 CPU

cpu.stat
Shows throttling and usage
nr_throttled > 0

cpu.pressure
Scheduler pain detector


3.Memory control (OOM reality)

memory.max
Hard memory limit
Cross it → OOM kill inside the cgroup

memory.current
Current memory usage

memory.stat
Breakdown of memory usage
Required for real OOM debugging

memory.pressure
Memory contention, even without OOMs


4. Process safety

This answers: can this thing fork-bomb me?

pids.max
Maximum processes allowed
