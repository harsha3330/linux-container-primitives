Problem : 

You have three applications on the same machine: 1)a Go server 2)a Node.js app 3)a C++ binary

Each of them needs:

/bin - - in the end most of these are binaries and executables
/lib
/usr/lib
/etc
runtime libraries
config files
So they all need… a Linux filesystem underneath

Solution : 
/bin/bash → same everywhere
/lib/libc.so → same
/usr/lib/* → same

What changes?
Go app writes logs
Node app writes node_modules/.cache
C++ app maybe writes temp files
App-specific configs


Overlay FIlesystem : 

lower layer (common linux files), upper layer (application files) , merged view (the applications see)
