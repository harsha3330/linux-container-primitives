Namespaces : 

** A Linux namespace decides what a process is allowed to see

Same machine. Same kernel.
Different processes get different views of reality.

1. main concerned with visibility of resources and access control 
2. namespaces can make it appear to the process that it has its own isolated copy of resources
3. namespaces can map outside a ns to resource in it 

Available namespaces : 

1. network
2. filesystem or mount
3. process
4. inter process communication
5. user and groups
6. hostname and domain namespace
7. cgroup
