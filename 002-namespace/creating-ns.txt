clone(2) and unshare(2) --> syscalls
CLONE_NEW


clone -->  new process to create new ns 
unshare --> for existing process to create new ns


You do not “create” namespaces directly.
You start a process, and the kernel places it into new namespaces.

No process → no namespace.



nsenter() --> to enter into new namespace


example commands : 

sudo unshare --net( type of namespace) bash
readlink /proc/$$/ns/* 



You do not add a process to a namespace.
You start a process and tell the kernel to attach it to an existing namespace.

That attachment happens via setns().
Humans usually access it through nsenter



The core rule (burn this in)

A new process inherits its parent’s namespaces by default.

Linux is conservative.
It only creates new namespaces when you explicitly ask for them.




****
When DOES a new namespace appear?

Only when one of these happens:

clone() is called with namespace flags
Example:
CLONE_NEWNET
CLONE_NEWPID

unshare() is called before fork/exec

A process calls setns() to join an existing namespace
No flag → no new namespace. Period.
